This very simple tool can convert RTF formatted text (e.g. from Word or other text editors) into HTML coding.

At the moment, after calling the .EXE file, it simply reads the current clipboard content, converts the code and then puts it back into the clipboard.

Background is, that the HTML code, which is generated e.g. by Word, contains much too many elements and especially the CSS is inserted very confusing per element. 

This tool is currently used mainly to transfer GuiXT scripts from Script Editor Pro to the online documentation.
